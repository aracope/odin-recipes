 <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups (175g or 6 oz) cubes of crusty bread</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pound ground pork sausage (remove casings from sausage if you can't find ground sausage)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary or Italian seasoning (or whatever you like, honestly)</li>
      <li>3/4 cup (100g) chopped yellow onion (about half a large onion. You can also use a shallot.)</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>2 cups (275g or 9-10 ounces) chopped bell peppers (or mini sweet peppers)</li>
      <li>1 cup (100g or 3 ounces) sliced mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 cup of fresh, roughly chopped spinach</li>
      <li>12 large eggs</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>2/3 cup (160 mL) milk or half and half</li>
      <li>1 cup (100 g or 3.5 ounces) shredded cheddar cheese</li>
      <li><strong>Optional garnish:</strong> green onions, chives, and/or fresh, chopped flat leaf parsley</li>
   </ul>

  <h1>The Process</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Grease a 9x13-inch or any 3-4 quart oven-safe dish. Arrange bread cubes in an even layer in bottom of pan.</li>
      <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add sausage and rosemary/Italian seasoning, if using, and break up the sausage into bite-size pieces with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula as it begins to cook.</li>
      <li>Add the onion, garlic, peppers, mushrooms, and spinach and cook until everything has slightly softened and sausage is mostly cooked through, about 5-6 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove sausage and vegetable mixture from heat and spread in an even layer on top of bread.</li>
      <li>Whisk the eggs, salt, pepper, milk, and cheese together. Evenly pour over sausage/vegetable mixture. Add another sprinkle of salt and pepper on top.</li>
      <li>Cover casserole with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours. <strong>When ready to bake, allow to sit at room temperature for 10-15 minutes as oven preheats.</strong></li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375F (191C). Bake the casserole, uncovered, until the top is golden, edges are crisp, and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 40-45 minutes.</li>
      <li>Cool for 10 minutes, then slice and serve. Leftovers keep well in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Reheat in the microwave to your liking.</li>
    </ol>
